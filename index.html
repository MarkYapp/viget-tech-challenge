      We use React to build rich, interaction-driven experiences on the web. Since 2013, Viget has
      been using React as our JavaScript (JS) library of choice for building user interfaces due to
      its component-based design, outstanding performance, and improved developer productivity. In
      addition to powering many immersive, interactive experiences across our websites and web
      applications, we've shared a number of React tools and components with the community.
